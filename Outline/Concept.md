# CommunityAction

## The Problem
 Currently even if a development team has created a strong bond and very enthuisatic support through engagement, constantly hitting roadmap milestones, and delivering everything. The issue is that the NFT space currently rewards first come and quickflips so incredibly well that long-term projects suffer in the interim and solid projects are constantly battling the FUD infiltrators in the community and spending valuable resources and time tempering that.


## The Solution
CommunityAction is an available platform for communities that feel they fall into the category as outlined above. Through this framework, a community can come together and contribute to an external entity that will help propogate the intended project. While being a part of a CommunityAction instance, the individuals have the ability to make decisions and guide the investment of resources held by the community.
